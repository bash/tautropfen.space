The burocratic and lengthy process for changing my legal name has put a lot of focus on the
*suffering* associated with my deadname rather than the *happiness* that comes with my new name.

Time to change that!

Towards that end, I thought it would be a sweet idea to describe each of my middle names as an individual person.
Careful: Some attributes may be *exaggerated* :)

### ðŸŒ™ Luna
*Luna* is a total space nerd. While you can barely list the eight planets of our solar system, she will talk your ears off about all the other strange and wonderful objects in our solar system and beyond. Luna is not afraid to face all of those difficult emotions in lifeâ€”she faces them heads on and always remembers to be kind to herself.

### ðŸ§™ Merlin
*Merlin* is a wizard. Nobody knows how they come up with solutions to the most *arcane* of coding problems. They're able to locate their roommate's phone at any time of day within 10 seconds. It's a mystery if they *actually* love helping others or if they're just annoyed at the other person's inability to solve the problem.

### ðŸª• Banjo
*Banjo* is an explorer. They are driven by an instatible desire to know more about our universe. Are they an archeologist, a physicist, an astronomer or a space pirate? *Nobody knows.* Banjo will give you all their attention if you teach them something new that you are knowledgeable about. If you want to seal the friendship read them *The Little Prince* at bedtime. Careful: They might cry a little at the end.

### ðŸŒŠ River
Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's a *River* and they are an unstoppable force
against injustice. They *magically* show up when someone needs their help day or night.
I have to admitâ€”I don't know them very well yet, but they sound like an *amazing* person.
I'm very eager to learn more about them.

I love each and every one of you~
