# Good Damage

diane nguyen fails \
to write down \
her trauma memoir

I too want to put \
my trauma \
from thoughts into words

thoughts are too flimsy \
words they are \
more believable

she struggles to find \
examples \
of childhood trauma

she only thinks of \
trivial \
unkindness and drifts

so hard to focus \
not to loose \
yourself for many hours

not able to stop \
unable \
to get of of bed

starting is easy \
but stopping \
can take oh so long

even though the parts \
may seem small \
the sum is much worse

diane thinks writing \
her memoir \
turns her trauma good

but trauma just is \
no meaning \
no deeper reason

I don't want to be \
though pretty \
a fixed salad bowl

I just want the dreams \
the terrors \
to finally end

my one hope is that \
the writing \
helps calm the demons
