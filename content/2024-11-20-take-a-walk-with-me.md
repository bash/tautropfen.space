title = "Take A Walk With Me"

There it is–how could I not recognize that light blue apartment building? It's three or perhaps four stories high.
To the right is another with the same washed out blue color. A small footpath lies between the buildings.
It ends in a a couple of stairs that connect it with the street in front of the two buildings.

On top of the stairs sits a small child, head in hands. They're perhaps ten or twelve years old.
Anyone would immediately notice their extremely short hair, evenly cut to the same length on all sides.
It's apparent from their facial expression that they would be crying if they hadn't been taught not to.

They look up and notice me, staring at them from across the street.
From their surprised face I gather that they must have recognized me immediately.
I decide to cross the street after dutifully checking that no car is approaching.
Unlikely given the late hour, but I want to be a good role model nonetheless.

I offer my hand to them: "Come, take a walk with me".

This one has been sitting in my drafts for quite a while–I almost forgot that it existed.
Since I'm not really in the headspace to continue with this–It's quite uncomfortable–I'm going ahead and
publishing this. Why not? <small>*Anmerkung des Chronisten*</small>
